      <h2>Singaporean Primary School Curriculum</h2>
      21st century competencies: A widely-desired set of outcomes of contemporary schooling although
      consensus on its components has never been achieved. In Singapore, these competencies are
      de4ned as encompassing a variety of social and emotional elements (e.g., self-management,
      responsible decision-making, relationship management) as well as a number of skills (e.g.,
      critical thinking, collaboration, communication & information skills). Together, they are
      believed toenable youth to work and 9ourish in an increasingly globalized and uncertain world.
      Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST): Master teachers are located at the AST, which is the
      branch of the Ministry of Education concerned with raising teacher professionalism and
      providing professional development for all government teachers in Singapore. Master Teachers:
      A select group (< 150 in the country) of experienced subject specialists who demonstrate
      high-quality teaching and leadership in mentoring others in pedagogy. They are at the pinnacle
      of their profession as classroom teachers. Curriculum Making & Resources Research on the
      curriculum in primary education. The primary curriculum in Singapore has been relatively
      insulated from the scrutiny of research (see Fang, [2002] for social studies; Kesevamoorthy
      (2011) for world music; Lee et al. [2017] and Tay [1993] for science); much of what we know
      has to be inferred from studies of system-wide reforms and educational initiatives in the
      country (Chan, 2011; Deng, Gopinathan & Lee, 2013). In 1997, the radically transformative
      Thinking Schools, Learning Nation policies justified cultivating a genuine passion for
      learning by moving away from a fixation on exam scores. This paved the way for Teach Less,
      Learn More in 2004 inaugurated by no less than the Prime Minister himself. Rather than rote
      learning and memorization as default pedagogies, student inquiry, risk-taking, and engaged
      learning were their replacements. Stressful assessment methods and teacher-centered classrooms
      were to make way for more collaborative student projects, open-book tests, and critical or
      creative thinking skills in every subject. These broad reforms also coincided with another
      ambitious blueprint for change by the Ministry of Education (MOE) at the beginning of this
      century––Ability-Driven Education (ADE)––that tried to mass customise learning to meet the
      needs of diverse learners: Every Singaporean counted, every talent was valued was the mantra.
      There were other reforms in the last two decades, but these descriptions give a flavour of the
      sea change in educational policies that have impacted the primary curriculum here. Of
      significance was the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) in 2009 that
      recommended changing mindsets concerning curriculum and pedagogies as well as promoting
      student agency and out-of-class learning. Apart from lessening the emphasis on formal
      assessments at lower primary levels, PERI advocated holistic assessment practices that could
      paint a more meaningful profile of the qualityof learning for both parents and students.
      Moreover, it argued for the importance of balancing knowledge with skills and values in a
      whole-school curriculum that was facilitated by a high-quality teaching force. Other
      influences. Koh (2004) labelled the above changes as tactical responses to globalization for
      at their heart, they were attempts to develop people who could think out of the box as well as
      educate competent citizen-workers fully at ease with living and working in the new economy. In
      primary schools, formative assessment or Assessment for Learning (AfL) has taken off massively
      with the close support of the MOE who provided workshop materials and new staff appointments
      such as AfL facilitators in each primary school. This enthusiasm to make routine assessment
      practices bolster learning to build student autonomy has resonated with many other educational
      systems since the 2000s (Sinnema & Aitkin, 2013). Curriculum structure. The structure of the
      local curriculum falls into three domains to ensure students obtain a well-rounded education
      (MOE, 2018a):Subject disciplines––the typical school subject areas of the languages,
      mathematics, sciences, humanities and the arts Knowledge skills––various thinking and
      communication skills taught/infused through schools subjects, often through project-work that
      are assessed or demonstrated individually or collaboratively in groupsLife
      skills––facilitated in daily social interactions informally (e.g., with teachers/classmates
      during the Form Teacher Guidance Periods) and formally (Character and Citizenship Education,
      Co-curricular Activities [CCA], Physical Education, National Education etc.) to build the
      right values and civic responsibility. While English is studied as a first language, all
      students must attend Mother Tongue (Chinese, Malay or Tamil languages) lessons as part of a
      longstanding policy of bilingualism. Even though English is increasingly the lingua franca in
      households, teaching the second languages remains a priority with differentiated instructional
      approaches in place and a greater emphasis now on listening and speaking skills for everyday
      fluency. Furthermore, there has been a move towards helping students actively explore the
      relevance of what they learn in school with the real world (the Applied Learning and Learning
      for Life Programmes), which also heightens the personal meaningfulness of abstract school
      subjects (e.g., using makerspaces to solve community issues, growing and harvesting
      rice/vegetables to share with the less fortunate). The buzzword heard often in Singapore
      schools is “the joy of learning” that few would disagree is so critical in primary education
      and indeed to all levels
